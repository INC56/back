## What is inc56

The "inc56" project is a complete infrastructure including :

* *A connected multimedia object*
  The connected object can be anything. We chose for testing purposes to focus on a connected videoprojector
* *A mobile device*
  Used to control the connected object by sending diverse commands to the connected object and display user data and files stored on the server. We built an Android application that can be found [here](https://github.com/INC56/app_project)
* *A server infrastructure*
  Holding user accounts, dealing with user authentification and making the link between the mobile devices and the connected objects

This project takes part of a first year course at the engineer school CentraleSupÃ©lec.

## What is in this repository

Here is the code for the server infrastructure. It is built using the python framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

> It is still under construction and largely incomplete.

## Requirements

This project uses python `3.6` and Django `2.0`
The following python packages are also required :

* `lxml` (see [here](http://lxml.de/))
* `python-resize-image` (see [here](https://pypi.org/project/python-resize-image/))
* `Pillow` (see [here](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.1.x/))
