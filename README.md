## What is inc56

The "inc56" project is a complete infrastructure including :

* *A connected multimedia object* that can be remotely controled
* *A mobile device* with an application to manage the client account / the connected object
* *A server infrastructure* to hold data and manage the interactions between the mobile device and the connected object

This project takes part of a first year course at the engineer school CentraleSupÃ©lec.

## What is in this repository

Here is the code for the server infrastructure. It is built using the python framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

> It is still under construction and largely incomplete.
